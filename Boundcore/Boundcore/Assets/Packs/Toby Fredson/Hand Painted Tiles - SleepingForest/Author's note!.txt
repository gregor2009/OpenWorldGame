For the sake of keeping everything simple and art asset related, I removed all standard assets and stuff that improves the vizuals, this is as barebone as it is. Remember to set your color space to linear rendering as the scenes were made for this color space and add lightmap UVs to all your models when you use GI! 

Enjoy!
